pagan
=====


Welcome to the python avatar generator for absolute nerds.

Remember those good old days when computer gaming was a big part of your 
imagination? Well, pagan tries to give back some of those nostalgic feelings
by providing identicons in an oldschool look, that are inspired from retro roleplaying
adventure games.

The software is currently under development and is going to feature the following functions:

* Generate random avatar images
* .. or process a given ip4 adress to generate identicons with unique colors and gear
* Create the avatar image based on a given resolution
* Pagan will map all virtual 16x16 Pixels to the real image size.
* Implement in your favorite internet board or blog. Generate avatars for new users automatically!
* Read the ip adress based on a pagan generated image.
* Expand pagan by your own needs, like adding new weapons or gear.
* Enjoy the nostalgia!
* Simply import pagan into your python programm or run pagan by itself to generate images on a default path.

Please check back at a later time to make use of a functional implemented pagan. I will try to keep this page updated when
progressing on the implementation of pagan.
